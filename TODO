On the revision:

- Add 'builds: -wasm' to package manifests.

On the release:

- Use legal{} target type for legal documentation (LICENSE, AUTHORS, etc).

- See if we can use ad hoc recipes to auto-generate .map and .def files.

- Use [cmdline] type for canned commands in
  openssl/tests/encryption.testscript.

- Switch to using -pthread instead of -D_REENTRANT/-lpthread in buildfiles.

Note: the above requires bumping build2 version requirement to 0.15.0.

Additional (permanent) notes:

- Review '@@ TMP' notes.

- Add/remove 'priority: security' manifest value, if required.
