On the revision:

On the release:

- Use legal{} target type for legal documentation (LICENSE, AUTHORS, etc).

- See if we can use ad hoc recipes to auto-generate .map and .def files.

- Use [cmdline] type for canned commands in
  openssl/tests/encryption.testscript.

Note: the above requires bumping build2 version requirement to 0.15.0.
