This document describes how the openssl program was packaged for build2. In
particular, this understanding will be useful when upgrading to a new upstream
version. See ../README-DEV for general notes on OpenSSL packaging.

Symlink the required upstream files and directories into openssl/:

$ ln -s ../../upstream/{apps,include/internal,e_os.h} openssl

Copy upstream's auto-generated apps/progs.h into openssl/. Note that this
header is not platform-specific.
