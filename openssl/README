OpenSSL is a robust, commercial-grade, and full-featured toolkit for the
Transport Layer Security (TLS) and Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) protocols with
openssl command line tool for using the various cryptography functions of
libcrypto and libssl libraries from the shell. For more information see:

https://www.openssl.org

This package contains the original openssl program source code overlaid with
the build2-based build system and packaged for the build2 package manager
(bpkg).

See the INSTALL file for the prerequisites and installation instructions.

Send questions, bug reports, or any other feedback about the program itself to
the OpenSSL mailing lists. Send build system and packaging-related feedback to
the packaging@build2.org mailing list (see https://lists.build2.org for posting
guidelines, etc).

The packaging of openssl for build2 is tracked in a Git repository at:

https://git.build2.org/cgit/packaging/openssl/
