This document describes how libssl was packaged for build2. In particular,
this understanding will be useful when upgrading to a new upstream version.
See ../README-DEV for general notes on OpenSSL packaging.

Symlink the required upstream files and directories into libssl/:

$ mkdir libssl/openssl
$ ln -s ../../../upstream/include/openssl/{dtls1,srtp,ssl2,ssl3,sslerr,ssl}.h \
  libssl/openssl
$ ln -s ../../upstream/{ssl,include/internal,e_os.h} libssl

Note that we take the libssl headers list from ../libcrypto/README-DEV.

Copy upstream's auto-generated libssl.map and libssl.def into libssl/. Comment
out the "LIBRARY libssl-1_1-x64" line in libssl.def.
