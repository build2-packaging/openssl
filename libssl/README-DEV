This document describes how libssl was packaged for build2. In particular,
this understanding will be useful when upgrading to a new upstream version.
See ../README-DEV for general notes on OpenSSL packaging.

Symlink the required upstream files and directories into libssl/:

$ ln -s ../../upstream/{ssl,include/internal} libssl

$ mkdir -p libssl/crypto/thread/arch
$ pushd libssl/crypto/thread/arch
$ ln -s ../../../../../upstream/crypto/thread/arch/*.c ./
$ cd ..
$ ln -s ../../../../upstream/crypto/thread/arch.c ./
$ cd ..
$ ln -s ../../../upstream/crypto/{ctype,getenv,packet,quic_vlint,time}.c ./
$ popd

Copy upstream's auto-generated libssl.{ld,def} into libssl/. Comment out the
"LIBRARY libssl-..." line in libssl.def.
